# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 - Rust Solutions 🦀

Hi! Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository. I hope you find it fun, helpful, or maybe just a little inspiring.

I’m learning Rust while solving these puzzles, so expect lots of comments along the code and some trial and error.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) is an annual calendar of programming puzzles that can be solved in any language. This year, I’ve chosen Rust because it’s new to me, and I'd like to learn the basics by solving small problems one day at a time.

Whether you’re a seasoned Rustacean or just here for some fun solutions, feel free to poke around!

## 📚 What’s Inside?

- **Commented Solutions**: Each solution comes with detailed comments explaining both the puzzle logic and Rust-specific syntax.
- **Easy Navigation**: Everything is organized by day so you can find what you’re looking for quickly.
- **Open Source**: Contributions are welcome! Whether it’s an alternative solution or just a suggestion to improve my Rust skills, I’d love to hear from you.
